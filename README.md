# NetsuiteApi

This library is designed to help ruby/rails based applications communicate with the publicly available REST API for NetSuite.

If you are unfamiliar with the NetSuite REST API, you should first read the documentation located at [SuiteTalk REST Web Services API Guide](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/book_1559132836.html).

The NetSuite REST API document could be found at [NetSuite REST API Browser: Record API v1](https://system.netsuite.com/help/helpcenter/en_US/APIs/REST_API_Browser/record/v1/2024.1/index.html#tag-account)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'netsuite_api'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install netsuite_api

## Basic Usage

### Setup Credential Information

Set All the credential information in your project .env file
```
NETSUITE_HOST = ""
NETSUITE_ACCOUNT_ID = ""
NETSUITE_CONSUMER_KEY = ""
NETSUITE_CONSUMER_SECRET = ""
NETSUITE_TOKEN = ""
NETSUITE_TOKEN_SECRET = ""
NETSUITE_PDF_HOST =
```

or pass those information when initialize NetsuiteApi instance, for example, initializing NetsuiteApi::Invoice
```
NetsuiteApi::Invoice.new(netsuite_host: "", netsuite_pdf_host: "", account_id: "", consumer_key: "", token: "", token_secret: "", consumer_secret: "")
```

## NetsuiteApi Object Usage

There are 7 objects could be used: `NetsuiteApi::Invoice`, `NetsuiteApi::CreditMemo`, `NetsuiteApi::Payment`, `NetsuiteApi::Customer`, `NetsuiteApi::Contact`, `NetsuiteApi::Vendor`, `NetsuiteApi::VendorBill`. 

More information about the objects could be found in `lib/netsuite_api`.

All the objects have method to get record, create data, update data, delete data in NetSuite through Netsuite REST API. 

Following section shows an example of using NetsuiteApi::Invoice. The way to use other objects is similar.

### Get data

* Get a specific invoice data. 
```
service = NetsuiteApi::Invoice.new
service.get(netsuite_invoice_id)
```

* Query some invoice data.
```
# query invoices which entity is 12

service = NetsuiteApi::Invoice.new
query_params = { "q" => "entity EQUAL 12" }
service.query(query_params)
```
More information about the query parameters could be found in [Record Collection Filtering](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/section_1545222128.html#Record-Collection-Filtering)
